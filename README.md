# Apple-Stock-Forecasting--Project

Introduction:

This project aims to predict Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock prices using time series forecasting techniques.

The model leverages historical stock price data, technical indicators, and machine learning/deep learning algorithms to make future price predictions.

OBJECTIVE:

Predict the Apple Stock market price for the next 30 days.

There are open, high , low and close prices that have been given for each day starting from 2012 to 2019 for Apple stock.

ABSTRACT:

Implemented a GRU model to capture stock price trends & Dependencies.

Achieved MAE: 3.7548 & RMSE: 5.2294,ensuring accurate predictions.

Deployed the model using streamlit for real-time stock price forecasting.

MODEL BULDINGS:

In this work, I compare different types of Machine- Learning Algorithms.

ARIMA(AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

SARIMA(Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

Exponential smoothing

Random Forest Regressor

support vector Regressor

Extreme Gradient Boosting

Long-short term Memory

Gated recurrent unit(Best Model)

1D Convolutional Neural Network

 In this all model Long-short term Memory is the Best model for the Apple Stock Forecasting.

TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED:

Jypter

Visual Studio Code

Streamlit

CHALLENGES FACED:

Stock Market Volatility - Sudden pricefluctuations made prediction challenging.

Non-stationary Data - Requried differencing & transforming to make it stationary.

Computational complexity - Deep learning models like LSTM & GRU required high processing power.

Deplyoment Issues - Implementing the model on streamlit & ensuring smooth real-time predictions.
